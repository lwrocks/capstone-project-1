    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      As an experienced developer and designer with over five years of
      professional experience, I am seeking a new challenge as a Product
      Designer. My recent experience as a Frontend Developer uniquely positions
      me to provide a technical perspective to the design process. I thrive in
      collaborative environments where everyone has a voice in the product
      development process. I am seeking a dynamic setting that fosters
      innovation, I am able to bridge the gap between technical feasibility and
      user-centered design, contributing to a team that embodies the spirit of
      creativity.
